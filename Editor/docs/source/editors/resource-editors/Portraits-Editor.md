# Portraits Editor

_last updated 2024-11-13_

## Checking Offsets

While the Smiling Offset (representing a portrait's mouth/speaking frames) will be visibly correct/incorrect in the portraits editor, the Blinking Offset will not unless you toggle the Blink option to check. Be sure to do so to avoid any offset autogeneration mistakes.

## Text Log Names

When referencing a portrait directly in a `speak` command, the text log feature will use the name of the portrait within this editor as the name of the speaker in the backlog. Remember this to avoid (or subtly place) spoilers in your text.
