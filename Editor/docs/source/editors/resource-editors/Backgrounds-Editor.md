## Multi-Image Backgrounds

In order to import a multi-image background, place all the images of that background in the same folder and give the images the same name with the order number of the image after the name, starting with 0.

For example, if you have 5 images, you can name them `image0.png`, `image1.png`, `image2.png`, `image3.png`, and `image4.png`.
