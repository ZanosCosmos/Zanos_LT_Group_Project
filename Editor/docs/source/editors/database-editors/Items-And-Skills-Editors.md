# Items And Skills Editors

These editors are very in-depth and control a large portion of any project's gameplay content. As such, a variety of pages and guides exist to help fully explain their functionality.

For tutorials about how to implement specific items and skills, please visit the [Skill and Item Tutorials](../../guides/skill_item_tutorials/index.rst) section. For information about individual components, please refer to the [Item Component Dictionary](Item-Component-Dictionary) and [Skill Component Dictionary](Skill-Component-Dictionary)
