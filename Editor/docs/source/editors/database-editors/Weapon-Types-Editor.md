# Weapon Types Editor

## Rank Bonuses

Units will use the highest rank bonus they qualify for out of the available bonuses. However, bonuses are *not* cumulative. This can cause (or allow for) strange behavior, such as a bonus decreasing when ascending in ranks.

Negative values are also respected for rank bonuses. You can have, for example, E-rank in a weapon grant an accuracy penalty.

## Market and Convoy Organization

Weapon types are used to display weapons in the base/preps market and the convoy. Therefore, all items should be assigned a weapon type (feel free to rename Consumables if your Fire Emblem is not consumable). This behavior can also be exploited for kaizo/troll projects by having valuables disappear even after 'being sent to convoy'.
