# Factions Editor


_last updated 2024-11-11_

## Generic Defaults

When you create generics via events and do not assign them a faction properly, they will default to whichever faction is at the top of this editor. If you want to create generics via events of differing factions, you will have to assign those factions correctly within the events themselves.
