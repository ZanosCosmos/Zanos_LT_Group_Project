# Terrain and Movement Costs Editors

_last updated 2024-11-11_

## In-Game Terrain Display

The DEF and AVO granted by terrain is determined by the Status assigned to the terrain. The status skill of a terrain can do things other than grant DEF and AVO (such as throne regeneration, for a classic example), but these other behaviors will not be displayed explicitly in-game.

## Line of Sight

Line of sight blocking allows certain terrain to prevent ranged attacks and/or auras from passing through. The appropriate line of sight constant must be enabled in the Constants editor to allow this behavior.

## New Terrain Types

In order to introduce new movement cost options in the Terrain editor, you must use the New Terrain Type button in the Movement Cost editor.
