# Teams Editor

## Banner Displays

When adding teams, new banner images will need to be provided for each new team's phase start. These should be in the format `turnbanner_TEAMNAME` and can be placed in the custom_sprites directory of your project.

For example, if you create a team named `enemy3`, you should place an image like the below named `turnbanner_enemy3.png` in your custom_sprites directory. Otherwise, a small error square will show up instead.

![Enemy3](../images/Enemy3.png)

Note that you can create new banners for existing teams as well by placing them in the same directory.
