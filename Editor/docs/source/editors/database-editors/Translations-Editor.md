# Translations Editor

_last updated 2024-11-13_

This editor is mainly used to provide info text (also known as R-text) for various menu options, as well as to fill out generic dialogue options such as for shops. For help with supporting non-English languages, refer to the [Fonts and Languages Guide](Fonts-Guide).

## Title Screen Text

To replace the text that says '_attribution' on the title screen of your project, simply add an entry to the translations with the NID `_attribution`.

## Event Region Text

If you create an event region, such as an Escape or Seize event, using the `INFO` button on that command in the menu will cause the default text 'EVENTNAME_desc' to appear. This can be replaced with meaningful text by adding an entry with that NID in the translations editor.
