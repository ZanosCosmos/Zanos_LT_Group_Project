# Guides Overview

This section of the documentation will provide instruction on how to create specific gameplay features or update aspects of the game that are changed in ways other than via the editor.

For ease of organization, these tutorials will be split into Asset tutorials, Eventing tutorials, and Skill/Item tutorials. Asset tutorials will generally require only the placement of files in the correct places in various directories directly on your computer, rather than through the editor. Eventing tutorials cover a variety of topics such as setting up an arena, and will occasionally require experience with the rest of the editor.
