# Breakable Walls

_last updated v0.1_

Weirdly enough, breakable walls in the **Lex Talionis** are not created using tiles or regions, but rather are invisible units you place on the map on top of the wall tile.

Since the breakable wall is a unit, it can interact in interesting ways with all the items and skills you have in your game.

## Creating a breakable wall

![WallClass](../images/WallClass.png)

1. Create a "Wall" class. The wall class should use an invisible map sprite. The HP of the "Wall" class determines the HP of the resulting breakable wall.

2. If you want the "Wall" to behave like a GBA wall where it can't be doubled, can't be crit, and cannot avoid attacks, you'll need to give it a skill that gives it a lot of defense speed, a lot of crit avoid and a negative amount of regular avoid.

3. For the chapter you want the wall to be present in, create a generic unit of the "Wall" class for each wall.

4. Now, you just need to catch the wall's death event and do something when the wall dies.

# Show destruction anim
map_anim;Snag;{position}
# Show the new layer
show_layer;Breakable1
```
