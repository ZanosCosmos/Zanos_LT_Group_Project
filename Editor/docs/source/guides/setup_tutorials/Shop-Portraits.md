# Shop Portraits

This guide will very swiftly illustrate how to update the three special shop portraits in LT maker: armory, vendor, and arena.

These portraits are not stored in the same way as standard unit portraits. Instead, to update these portraits, you must use the **resources/custom_sprites** directory in your project. If a **custom_sprites** directory does not already exist for your project, create one (make sure it's named exactly **custom_sprites**).

![CustomSpritesFileExplorer](../images/custom_sprites.png)

Then, place the portrait you wish to use in this directory and name it one of the following file names to replace its respective default portrait:

**arena_portrait.png**<br>
**armory_portrait.png**<br>
**vendor_portrait.png**

Now when you set up a shop of that type in a shop event, you should see your replaced portrait.
