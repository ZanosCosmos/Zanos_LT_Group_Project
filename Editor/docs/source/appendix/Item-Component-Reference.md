# Item Component Dictionary

The item components in this dictionary are broken down by icon going from left to right, with each icon's aspects being explained top to bottom.

## Essential Aspects:

| Component | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| **No AI** | Adding this component prevents the AI from trying to use the item. This is important for sequence items, which the AI is unable to handle. |
| **Spell** | This item will be included under the Spells menu instead of the Attack menu. A useful way to separate weapons from utility items like staves or non-damaging tomes. |
| **Weapon** | Item is a weapon that can be used to attack and initiate combat. Important to add to anything that's being used for that purpose. |
| **Siege Weapon** | The weapon cannot counterattack or be counterattacked, but can be equipped and double. Used instead of the weapon component. |
| **Usable** | Item can be used from the items menu. Must be paired with the Targets Allies component. |
| **Usable in Base** | Item is usable in base. Must be paired with the Targets Allies component. |
| **Unrepairable** | An item with the repair component cannot repair an item with this component. |
| **Value** | The value that the item can be bought and sold for in shops. |
| **Accessory** | The item is considered an accessory and takes up an accessory slot in a unit's inventory. Make sure to increase the number of accessory slots to more than zero and have a total number of inventory + accessory slots less than six. |
| **Item Prefab** | The item inherits all the components of the selected item. |
| **Item Tags** | The item gains all of the associated tags. Note: the tags are associated to the item instead of any unit.

## Targeting:

| Component | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| **Targets Anything** | Any tile can be targeted by this item. |
| **Targets Units** | Any unit within range, regardless of team, can be targeted. |
| **Targets Enemies** | Can only target enemy units. |
| **Targets Allies** | Can only target allied units, including green units (assuming a player is using the item). |
| **EvalSpecialRange** | Takes a condition accepting `x`, `y` that will limit what positions relative to the unit can be targeted within range. For example, the condition `x == 0 or y == 0` will lock the range to a "cross" shape, allowing the unit to shoot directly vertically or horizontally.
| **Eval Target Restrict** | This component takes a string that will be evaluated in python. If the string evaluates to false for a targeted unit they cannot be targeted by this weapon. See an upcoming guide for options when creating these strings. |
| **Empty Tile Target Restrict** | Used in conjunction with Targets Anything to restrict the target to empty tiles. |
| **Minimum Range** | A fixed integer that sets the minimum range of an item. Zero means that it can target the user. Unneeded for usable items. Don't go into the negatives. |
| **Maximum Range** | A fixed integer that sets the maximum range of an item. |
| **Maximum Equation Range** | Refers to an equation defined in the equations editor. The maximum range is set to the evaluated value of that equation. Useful for staves like Warp or Physic that are based on the user's magic. |
| **Global Range** | Anywhere on the map can be a potential target for this item. |

## Weapon Components:

| Component | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| **Weapon Type** | The type of weapon that the wielder must be able to use in order to attack with this item. |
| **Weapon Rank** | The rank of the desired weapon type needed to use this item. |
| **Magic** | Item uses magic formulas for calculating damage. |
| **Magic at Range** | Item uses magic formulas only at range (Levin or Wind Sword) |
| **Hit** | The base hit value of the item. Factored into the overall hit equation. |
| **Damage** | The base might of the item. |
| **Crit** | The base crit of the item. |
| **Weight** | Lowers effective speed. At first, subtracted from the CONSTITUTION equation. If negative, subtracts from speed resulting in a unit's effective speed. |
| **Unwieldy** | When equipped, defense is reduced by the specified integer. |
| **Stat Change** | A list of stats that correspond to integers. When equipped, stats are changed by that amount. |

## Restrictions:

| Component | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| **Uses** | The item's total uses. The item will be destroyed when uses reach zero. |
| **Chapter Uses** | The item's uses per chapter. The uses recharge to full at chapter end, even if all are used. Do not combine with the uses component. |
| **HPCost** | Item subtracts the specified amount of HP upon use. If the subtraction would kill the unit the item becomes unusable. |
| **Mana Cost** | Item subtracts the specified amount of Mana upon use. MANA must be defined in the equations editor. If unit does not have enough mana the item will not be usable. |
| **Cooldown** | The item cannot be used for the specified number of turns. Since timers tick down at the start of the turn, setting cooldown to one will allow the unit to use the item on their next turn. |
| **Prf Unit** | Only the chosen units can use this weapon. |
| **Prf Class** | Only the chosen classes can use this weapon. |
| **Prf Tag** | Only units with the chosen tags can use this weapon. |

## EXP:

| Component | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| **EXP** | Item gives a fixed integer of EXP each use. Useful for staves like Warp or Rescue. |
| **Level EXP** | Gives EXP based on the level difference between attacker and defender. How EXP is normally calculated for weapons, with higher level enemies granting more EXP |
| **Heal EXP** | Gives EXP based on the amount healed. |
| **WEXP** | Gives a fixed integer of weapon EXP. |
| **Fatigue** | If fatigue is enabled, increases the amount of fatigue a user suffers while using this item. Can be negative in order to remove fatigue. |

## Promotion:

| Component | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| **Promote** | Promotes the targeted unit (most often the user) into whatever promotions their class has available to them. |
| **Force Promote** | Promotes the targeted unit into the class specified in the component. |

| **Status On Hold** | A unit with this item in their inventory will receive the specified status. |
| **Gain Mana After Combat** | Takes a string that will be evaluated by python. At the end of combat the string is evaluated if the item was used and the result is translated into mana gained by the unit. If you want a flat gain of X mana, enter `X`, where X is an integer. |

## Staff Components:

| Component | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| **Heal** | Heals the target for the specified integer. |
| **Magic Heal** | Heals the target for the specified integer + the HEAL equation defined in the equations editor. Will act oddly if no HEAL equation is defined. |

| **Fatigue on Hit** | If fatigue is enabled, increases the amount of fatigue a target suffers when hit by this item. Can be negative in order to remove fatigue. |
| **Status on Hit** | Target gains the specified status on hit. Applies instantly, potentially causing values to change mid-combat. |
| **Status After Combat on Hit** | If the target is hit they gain the specified status at the end of combat. Prevents changes being applied mid-combat. |
| **Shove** | Unit is shoved the specified number of tiles. |
| **Shove Target Restrict** | Works the same as shove but will not allow the item to be selected if the action cannot be performed. |
| **Swap** | The user and adjacent target's positions are swapped. |

| **Draw Back Target Restrict** | Works the same as draw back but will not allow the item to be selected if the action cannot be performed. |
| **Steal** | On hit the user may steal any non-equipped item from the target. |
| **GBASteal** | On hit the user may steal non-weapon and non-spell item from the target. |
| **Event On Hit** | The selected event plays before a hit, if the unit will hit with this item. The event is triggered with args (`unit1`=attacking unit, `unit2`=target, `item`=item, `position`=attacking unit's position, `region`=targeted position) |
| **Event After Combat** | The selected event plays at the end of combat so long as an attack in combat hit. |

## Alternate Formulas

Each of the alternate formulas here replace the specified stat with a selected equation from the equations editor. Most are self explanatory.

Resist - Resist refers to both defense and resistance. Increasing a unit's resist will decrease the damage they take, regardless of magic/physical damage. Magic items essentially use this component, by swapping the enemy's normal DEFENSE equation for the alternate resist formula of MAGIC_DEFENSE.

Attack vs Defense Speed - Lex Talionis can calculate speed when being attacked differently than speed when attacking. These two components are part of this distinction.
