# Skill Component Dictionary

The item components in this dictionary are broken down by icon going from left to right, with each icon's aspects being explained top to bottom.

## Attribute Components

| Component | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| **Hidden** |  The skill/status will not appear anywhere in the unit's info menu. |
| **Class Skill** |  The skill/status will appear in the unit's 'personal data' page in their info menu, rather than on the 'weapon and support level' page. |
| **Stack** |  The skill/status can be applied multiple times. Useful when creating skills such as "+1 Strength every time an enemy is defeated". |
| **Feat** |  The skill/status can be selected as a _Feat_.  |
| **Negative** |  Skill/status is considered _Detrimental_. This status cannot be applied to a unit with any skill using the "ImmuneStatus" skill component. This status can be cleared by an item using the "Restore" item component. |
| **Global** |  All units will be affected by this skill/status. |
| **Negate** |  Negates all effective damage. |
| **Negate Tags** |  Negates effective damage against the specified tags. For example, to recreate Iote's shield, we would select the "Flying" tag. |

## Base Components

| **Unselectable** |  Unit cannot be selected by the player. A use case would be for a berserked ally. |
| **Cannot Use Items** |  The unit cannot use nor equip any items. |
| **Cannot Use Magic Items** |  The unit cannot use nor equip any items that have the "Magic" item component. Also prevents using items with the "Magic At Range" component from greater than range 1. |
| **Additional Accessories** |  Trades item slots for accessory slots. |
| **Ignore Alliances** |  The affected unit can attack any team. Useful for stuff like Thracia Green units that could attack the player. |
| **Change AI** |  Changes the unit's AI to the one specified. Can accept any AI setting, including those made with the AI editor. |

| **Exp Multiplier** |  Multiplies the amount of EXP the affected unit receives by the specified value. For Paragon, one would enter a value of 2.00 (i.e., 200% of the normal amount). |
| **Enemy Exp Multiplier** |  Alters the amount of EXP this unit gives. For Void Curse, one would give this a value of 0.00 and assign it to enemies. These enemies now give no EXP when fought. |
| **Wexp Multiplier** |  Multiplies the amount of WEXP the affected unit receives by the specified value. |
| **Can Use Weapon Type** |  Allows usage of the specified weapon type. Do note that the unit will still need a WEXP value above 0 for this to work. This component exists to allow a class to wield a weapon they normally could not use. For example, if Franz had 1 Axe WEXP and did not have this component, he would still not be able to use an Iron Axe. Once this component is applied, he will be able to use the Iron Axe.
| **Enemy Wexp Multiplier** |  Alters the amount of WEXP that units besides the affected unit receives, by the specified value. |
| **Locktouch** |  Gives the affected unit the ability to unlock. `can_unlock` will return True for this unit, allowing them to interact with regions that use `can_unlock` as a condition. Refer to the eventing tutorials for more details. |
