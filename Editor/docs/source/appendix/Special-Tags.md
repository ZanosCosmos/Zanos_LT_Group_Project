# Special Tags

_last updated v0.1_

This appendix details every tag that the **Lex Talionis** engine handles uniquely. You can of course assign other tags to units and classes and check for them in your own event scripts or item/skill components.

Both units and classes can be assigned tags. A unit in game has it's own tags as well as the tags of it's class. 

**Lord** - If 'Autocursor' is **ON**, will be hovered over by the cursor when the player phase starts.

**Boss** - The unit will be designated as a boss. They will have a boss icon on their sprite, and give more EXP when defeated if the _Boss Bonus_ constant is set. 

**Required** - Unit must be chosen from among the list of available units to deploy in the Prep Screen.

**Blacklist** - Unit cannot be deployed for the chapter in the Prep Screen.

**Armor** - Denotes a unit as Armor. Affects movement SFX when the unit walks.

**Mounted** - Denotes a unit as Mounted. Affects movement SFX, as well as the Aid icon.

**Flying** - Denotes a unit as Flying. Affects movement SFX, as well as the Aid icon.

**Dragon** - Denotes a unit as a Dragon. Used for the Aid icon.

**AutoPromote** - This unit/class will automatically promote if they level past their class's maximum level.

**NoAutoPromote** - This unit/class cannot promote via leveling up past their class's maximum level.

**Convoy** - Allows the unit/class to access the convoy during their turn.

**AdjConvoy** - Allows allies adjacent to the unit/class to access the convoy during their turn.

**Tile** - Denotes a unit should behave as a destructible tile. Unit cannot be selected, and will not show up in the Info Menu. Unit will also not be contained in most lists of units throughout the engine.
